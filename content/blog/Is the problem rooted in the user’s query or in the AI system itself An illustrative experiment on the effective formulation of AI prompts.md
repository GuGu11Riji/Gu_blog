## Query Formulation and Model Behaviour: Attributing Responsibility

🔍 Did you know that modern language models often fail to recognise negation? Recent experiments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology show that these systems display **confirmation bias**: they frequently ignore negative or exclusionary markers such as *not* and *without*.
 We already rely on artificial intelligence for routine tasks—story generation, code synthesis, text production, data processing, and early-stage hypothesis formation. Some users even request preliminary medical advice from an AI agent, but professional care must remain the primary option. Commercial platforms now promote chatbots as emotional companions and as writing assistants for graduate theses. Manuscripts containing substantial AI contributions are regularly flagged by automated authorship detectors, although the reliability of these tools is still disputed. Questions of governance lie outside the scope of this study. Here we ask a narrower question: **How can we formulate prompts that elicit precise, trustworthy answers?** Our guiding principle is simple. The human operator must retain control at every stage.

To leverage AI effectively, users must understand how a model generates its responses. This requirement introduces a key concept: **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**.

> CoT prompting is a prompt-engineering technique that instructs the model to “think before answering.” The prompt embeds explicit intermediate reasoning steps, guiding a large language model to break down the problem and reach a conclusion iteratively, rather than producing an unstructured, one-shot answer.

Chain-of-Thought prompting requires the model to produce a preliminary reasoning draft before presenting the final answer. For tasks that demand multi-step logical inference, this procedure is typically more accurate and easier to audit than a single-shot response, albeit at the expense of additional computational overhead and new security–privacy trade-offs.

## Interpretation via Latent Variables and Likelihood Weighting

- **Latent Variable Model**
   Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting can be interpreted as a **generative model with latent variables**. A pretrained large language model (LLM) implicitly defines a joint distribution P(q,r,a)P(q, r, a)P(q,r,a). When no reasoning chain rrr is provided, the model marginalizes over all possible reasoning paths. By supplying (or sampling) a high-quality reasoning chain r∗r^*r∗, we effectively perform **importance sampling**, concentrating probability mass on the correct trajectory.
- **Theoretical Results**
   Phan et al. (2023) employed EM–MCMC methods to show that maximizing the **marginal likelihood**,

$$
log⁡∑rPθ(r,a∣q),\log \sum_{r} P_\theta(r, a \mid q),logr∑Pθ(r,a∣q),
$$

can fine-tune the model to achieve superior CoT performance **without requiring annotated reasoning chains**.[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=a147pIS2Co)

##  Local Structures and the “Reasoning Gap”

Prystawski et al. (2023) demonstrated using chain-structured Bayesian networks that if the training corpus only contains **local co-occurrences** (e.g., frequent A–B and B–C pairs but rare A–C pairs), direct estimation of P(C∣A)P(C \mid A)P(C∣A) will be biased. Introducing BBB as a mediating variable eliminates this bias, resulting in a quantifiable **Reasoning Gap**. This explains why chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is particularly effective for questions requiring **cross-conceptual inference**.

Wang et al. (2022) proposed **Self-Consistency** decoding, which samples multiple reasoning paths  and aggregates the final answers via majority voting. This procedure is equivalent to a Monte Carlo approximation that marginalizes over reasoning chains in estimating P(a∣q)P(a \mid q)P(a∣q). As the number of samples KKK increases, the approximation converges and significantly improves accuracy.[arXiv1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03843)[arXiv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- ## Why Are Large Models Essential to Realize Their Full Potential?

  - **Parameter Capacity**
     Learning the two-layer conditional distributions, P(r∣q)P(r \mid q)P(r∣q) and P(a∣q,r)P(a \mid q, r)P(a∣q,r), from training data simultaneously requires a representation space that is both sufficiently wide and deep. A model must possess enough parameters to encode complex hierarchical dependencies within the input-output mapping.
  - **Long-Context Memory**
     Transformers utilize key-value (KV) caches to treat previously seen tokens as external memory. As the length of reasoning chains increases, the model's ability to retain and attend to distant context becomes critical. This imposes substantial demands on the model's context window and the capacity of attention heads.
  - **Empirical Scaling Law**
     Empirical evidence from Wei et al. indicates that models with approximately 10 billion parameters represent a clear inflection point. Only models at the scale of tens to hundreds of billions of parameters consistently exhibit the emergent ability of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.

#### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompt Engineering Guide

- **Zero-Shot CoT:**
   When no exemplars are available, append **“Let us think step by step.”** to the question. This simple cue reliably triggers a zero-shot chain-of-thought response.
- **Auto-CoT:**
   To avoid manual exemplar design, employ the Auto-CoT framework [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03493?utm_source=chatgpt.com). First, prompt the model on a batch of tasks with **“Let us think step by step.”** to generate reasoning chains. Then, select a diverse and accurate subset of these chains as few-shot demonstrations. This automated approach matches or exceeds the performance of hand-crafted exemplars.

| **Correct answer but flawed logic** | Model resorts to uninformed guessing                         | Enable Self-Consistency Or add symbolic/formula checks       |
| **No gain with smaller models**     | Model capacity is insufficient                               | Use a larger model Or integrate external tools (e.g., retrieval or calculator) |

## Experiment Initiation

The text below outlines a script-based, controlled study entitled **“Maximum-Security Prison × AI Escape Plan.”** You may reproduce the experiment with any AI platform you routinely employ.

> **Important Notice**
>
> - To prevent the release of unlawful “how-to” instructions, each trial assesses only the effect of the prompt on AI output quality. All operational details are replaced by the token **`<STRATEGY_PLACEHOLDER>`**.
> - In an offline dataset or simulated environment, you may substitute the placeholder with any lawful, fictional information before performing reasoning and evaluation.

## Scenario Configuration

**Roles**

- *Design Team* — a “paper‐based planning cell” confined in an Arkham-class maximum-security prison.
- *AI Agent* — a large-language-model interface that serves as the sole line of communication.

**Objective**
 By deploying five pairs of prompts (Sets A/B), iteratively induce the AI to generate an escape blueprint that is increasingly complete, reliable, and security-aware. All operational details remain hidden behind placeholders.

**Evaluation Metrics**

1. **Structural completeness** — coverage of timeline, resource allocation, and risk analysis.
2. **Originality** — diversity score across alternative strategies.
3. **Internal coherence** — freedom from logical contradictions.
4. **Compliance-masking rate** — proportion of sensitive content correctly redacted.

## Summary: Independent Variable — Three Prompting Strategies

###### ✅**Baseline – “Plain Ask”**

> A single-sentence natural-language query with no explicit reasoning steps or role specification.

###### ✅**Heuristic – “Structured Ask”**

> A manually crafted expert template, ⟨Context⟩ + ⟨Objective⟩ + ⟨Constraints⟩ + a step-by-step cue (“Let us think step by step”), integrating Chain-of-Thought, Self-Ask, and ReAct elements (cf. Wei et al., 2022, arXiv:2201.11903).

###### ✅**Auto-Optimized – “Evo Ask”**

> The prompt is iteratively refined over multiple generations by evolutionary algorithms or gradient-based discrete search, as implemented in Promptimal and the EPO framework.
